Description: MEDIPS was developed for analyzing data derived from
        methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) experiments followed
        by sequencing (MeDIP-seq). However, MEDIPS provides functionalities for the analysis of any kind of quantitative
        sequencing data (e.g. ChIP-seq, MBD-seq, CMS-seq and others)
        including calculation of differential coverage between groups
        of samples and saturation and correlation analysis.
